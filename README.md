# ParabolicShapeGradient
Numerical approximations of shape gradients were noticed in the shape optimization community. The error of the distributed shape gradient is shown to have super-convergence rate w.r.t. mesh size than that of the boundary type. A priori error estimates w.r.t. time step size are also presented.
